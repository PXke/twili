Use ppmake to make a repo from the pkgs/ files and pprestore to make a pkgs/ from a repo in out.

ppnewpkg lets you easily add a package.

THINGS TO REMEMBER:
- When you have a piece of code that can easily change and make a patch incompatible, sed may be a good idea.
- Forking is fine! Send pull requests! Help us grow!

KNOWN BUGS:
- __syscallarg not defined - add "#undef __syscall" before the code tha breaks.

INSTALLATION:
1. Grab a chroot ( http://twi.asiekierka.pl/chroot2v1.tar.bz2 )

3. sudo setarch i686 chroot . (you don't need setarch on 32-bit platforms)
4. ./init.sh to initialize /dev, /proc and /sys
4a. You may also want to set MAKEFLAGS to -j2 on a dualcore or -j3 on a quad or whatever
5. mkdir output - for the installation process
6. Download the installer ( http://twi.asiekierka.pl/installer.tar.bz2 )
7. /install/installer.pl
7a. Give it /output/ as the path.
