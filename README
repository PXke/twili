Use ppmake to make a repo from the pkgs/ files and pprestore to make a pkgs/ from a repo in out.

ppnewpkg lets you easily add a package.

THINGS TO REMEMBER:

- When you have a piece of code that can easily change and make a patch incompatible, sed may be a good idea.
- Forking is fine! Send pull requests! Help us grow!
