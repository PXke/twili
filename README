Use ppmake to make a repo from the pkgs/ files and pprestore to make a pkgs/ from a repo in out.

ppnewpkg lets you easily add a package.

THINGS TO REMEMBER:
- When you have a piece of code that can easily change and make a patch incompatible, sed may be a good idea.
- Forking is fine! Send pull requests! Help us grow!

TODO:

- Add env var support (PP_APP_VER, PP_APP_NAME, etc) to pppkg
- Port busybox 1.20.2 from https://github.com/rofl0r/sabotage/blob/master/pkg/busybox
- Fix X server (non-kdrive) [IMPORTANT]
- Test pkgconf as a replacement for pkg-config
- Add xz to packages [when we have new chroot with builtin xz]
